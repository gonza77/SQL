# Inner Join, Outer Join, Left Outer Join, Right Outer Join
# I see you inserted new rows in EmployeeDemographics and created WareHouseEmployeeDemographics, but you did not put the code on Git. I will let it here, hope it helps:

Table 1 Insert:

Insert into EmployeeDemographics VALUES

(NULL, 'Holly', 'Flax', NULL, NULL),

Table 3 Query:

Create Table WareHouseEmployeeDemographics 

(EmployeeID int, 

FirstName varchar(50), 

LastName varchar(50), 

Age int, 

Gender varchar(50)

)



Table 3 Insert:

Insert into WareHouseEmployeeDemographics VALUES
